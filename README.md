# Lid Driven Cavity Problem using Staggered Finite Volume Explicit Method

- Cartesian Grid Coordinate system is used
- The over-relaxation parameter and convergence criteria for pressure solver 
and velocity can be manually changed by the user
- For reference, the streamline patterns and numerical code validation (centerline
velocity profiles) with a benchmark result are also attached herewith.
